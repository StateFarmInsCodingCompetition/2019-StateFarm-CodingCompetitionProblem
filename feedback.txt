How many JUnits were you able to get to pass? 10/10

Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
	1: JavaDocs
	2: Created PNG utilizing R to generate visualizations for the data easy for many people to understand.
	3: Created GUI in Gui.java for the user to utilize the CSV Utility. In order to open and access the GUI, run the main method in Gui.java.
	In the GUI you will be able to select the data source and what method you wish to run on it. Based on this, it will show a parameter box which has
	what it type of parameter it is expecting (there is a tooltip if you hover over it as well). 
	Based on the parameters given, method chosen, and data set, it will output the information that the user requested.
	
	
	
Feedback for the coding competition?  Things you would like to see in future events?
Loved it, but perhaps maybe more guidance/instruction on what exactly each method should do or give a more detailled background on the context of the programming.
