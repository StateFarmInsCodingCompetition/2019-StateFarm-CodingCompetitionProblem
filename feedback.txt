	Step 1: We added a custom method to display countries that had a disaster based on year of input. If there are countries that reported incidences during that year, they will get outputted.
	Step 2: We added a custom method to reports whether you are at high, average, or low risk for a natural disaster based on where you are located and this could determine how your insurance impacts you.
