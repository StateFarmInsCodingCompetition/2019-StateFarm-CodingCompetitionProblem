Document and describe any enhancements included to help the judges properly grade your submission.
	Added Javadocs
		We wanted to make our code as understandable as possible, so the addition of javadocs makes
		each function very simple to understand.
	Following CheckStyle-6.2.2
		To ensure cleanliness and readability in our code, we decided to follow the guidelines
		established by CheckStyle-6.2.2.
	Attempting to be time efficient with iterations over functions based on disaster category
		The code will only perform evaluations for entries of the correct category. Once an entry
		is found in the wrong category, the function will stop processing the list given that the
		data is sorted by category.
